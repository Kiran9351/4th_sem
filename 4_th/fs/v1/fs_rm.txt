	- Write to file 
		- Ask for filename, filesize
		- Check if there are enough datablocks
		- check for FMD block availability
		- get first block of file
		- write fmd to disk.

		- get all the required datablock no. and write them to first block.

		- Read datablcok nos. from first block one by one and write the 
		actual data into datablock, using Diskdriver code.

	- we can keep total bits available beforehand to compare with required bits
	so that we don't need to counts availalble bits everytime.

	- need to access get bmap from every function whenever we need (i think).
	otherwise need to keep bmap global array.
